# Homework-Assignment-9-Template-Literals
Modify your pages so that all of the HTML within the &lt;body> is written by Javascript (rather than hardcoded onto the page). Break all your HTML into separate Javascript templates, using template literals. Make sure that any variables that appear are not harcoded, but are presented via those template literals. Keep your templates free of as much text and numbers as possible, pushing all that data into variables instead.
